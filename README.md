<h1>Processor Emulator</h1>
Implement an emulator for your own CPU architecture. The processor's programming model should include four 64-bit general-purpose registers, a program counter, and a 64-bit address space. 
The content of each memory address should be 1 byte long. The instruction set should include:

-Basic arithmetic operations on general-purpose registers (ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV),    
-Basic bitwise logic operations on general-purpose registers (AND, OR, NOT, and XOR),    
-Data transfer instructions (MOV), with support for direct and indirect addressing,    
-Instructions for unconditional and conditional branching (JMP, JE, JNE, JGE, JL, CMP), with support for both direct and indirect branching,    
-I/O routines for reading a character from the keyboard into a register and displaying a character from a register on the screen, and    
-An instruction to stop the processor (HALT)
